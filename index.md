> My PhD work focused on advancing the understanding of electron-nuclear coupling on molecular behavior by developing rigorous and practical mixed quantum-classical methods based on the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction. 

## Machine Learning Projects 
1. [LaLiga Soccer Sage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5262f50-da17-4200-b74c-098e2aadeae4)

</p>


> In this project we developed a random forest model to predict La Liga soccer match outcomes. The model features were engineered from historical match data, including team perfromance metrics and situational factors. The model achieved 75% accuracy and outperformed bookmaker implied probabilities by 24%.

1. [GenAI-Powered Solutions for the Restaurant Industry](https://github.com/EIB-Restaurant/burnt_labels)

> In this project we fine-tuned large language models (LLaMA 2, BERT, GPT-2) to standardize product categorization across restaurant suppliers, achieving ~92.5% classification accuracy. We leveraged efficient fine-tuning techniques, including LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation), to enhance performance while reducing computational costs.
