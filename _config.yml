  <br> I am a physicist driven by a passion for understanding, modeling, and explaining the world around me. My PhD research, at the intersection of chemistry and physics, focused on developing efficient and accurate algorithms to simulate photochemical processes. <br><br> I thrive on solving real-world problems through data-driven modeling, leveraging my skills across various domains. In addition to modeling the fundamental interactions driving photochemistry, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects with strong potenital for business impact, such as predicting La Liga match outcomes and optimizing restaurant supply classification.
