  <br> I am a physicist driven by a passion for modeling, and explaining the world around me. During my PhD, I developed novel algorithms for molecular simulations aimign to understand how tiny particles that move on time scales of quadrillionths of a second drive complex molecular behavior.<br><br> That same drive to model and explain the world now fuels my work in AI, where I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and impact. Whether I’m forecasting restaurant demand, predicting La Liga match outcomes, or building GenAI-powered assistants, I’m always looking for creative, data-driven ways to solve real-world problems.
